When using TangleGuard the architecture desicions should be added into the system, so that TangleGaurd can help to enforce them until they offically change.

So far TangleGaurd supports Layers and Dependency Rules.
Support for more descicions will be added.
But not all architecture descisoin can be enforced.
For those, TangleGuard lets you document the decisions as a plain text document, which is based on a tamplate.
