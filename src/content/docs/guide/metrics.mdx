Tangle-guard includes a **dashboard** with key architectural metrics — giving you visibility into the health and maintainability of your system.

Metrics include:

- **Coupling** (efferent and afferent)
- Layer violations over time
- Instability indicators

For a full list of supported metrics, check the [scanner metrics section](scanner#metrics-for-design-principles).

### Design Principle Metrics 

<Aside>
  These metrics help evaluate **responsibility, stability, and resistance to
  change** in your modules.

The scanner also calculates metrics.

In addition to dependency graphs, the scanner calculates **architecture-focused metrics** to help evaluate code structure and modularity.

These are based on foundational work by **Robert C. Martin** and **John Lakos**.

### Metrics by Robert C. Martin

| Metric                 | Description                                                   |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Afferent Coupling (Ca) | Number of packages that depend on a given package             |
| Efferent Coupling (Ce) | Number of other packages a package depends on                 |
| Instability (I)        | `Ce / (Ce + Ca)` — measures how likely a package is to change |

### Metrics by John Lakos <Badge text="Coming soon" variant="note" />

| Metric                                | Description                                 |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Depends Upon / Used From (V)          | Basic inbound/outbound dependency counts    |
| Cumulative Component Dependency (CCD) | Total transitive dependencies               |
| Average Component Dependency (ACD)    | `CCD / amount_of_components`                |
| Relative ACD (RACD)                   | `(ACD / amount_of–components) * 100`        |
| Normalized CCD (NCCD)                 | CCD normalized against a reference baseline |
