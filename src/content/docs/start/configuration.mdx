All information and configurations associated to your architecture is stored in a file in the root of your project.
If you run tangle-guard for the first time, it will create that file for you.

<FileTree>

- src
- Cargo.toml
- **architecture-def.json**

</FileTree>

The file is supposed to be included in Git.
That way changes will be tracked over time and can be reviewed before merging like a normal code changes.

Below you see an example configuration.

```json
{
  "layers": [
    {
      "name": "Interaction",
      "description": "",
      "packages": ["rest-api", "graphql-api"]
    }
  ],
  "packages": [
    {
      "name": "rest-api",
      "dependencies": ["utils"],
      "focus": "technical"
    }
  ],
  "rules": [
    {
      "from": "Interaction",
      "to": "Services"
    }
  ],
  "domains": [
    {
      "name": "User Management",
      "dsl": ["OAuth", "Token", "Role"],
      "domain_type": "Generic"
    }
  ]
}
```

You can edit the file manually but it's highly recommended to use the web UI instead.
<Aside type="caution">
  If you make changes to the configuration file directly, there is a change that
  the data is not consistent anymore. E.g. if you rename a layer, make sure you
  rename the layer also within the rules. To omit this problem, it's recommended
  to adjust the configuration only via the UI.
