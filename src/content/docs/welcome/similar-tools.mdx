Although TangleGuard has a unique approach, software architecture is already actively enforced in software projects with the help of tools.
These tools are discussed here with it's strength, uniqueness and limitations.


## Dependency Cruiser (JS/TS)
<Badge text="Rule Enforcement" variant="note" />
<Badge text="Visualization" variant="note" />

[Dependency Cruiser](https://github.com/sverweij/dependency-cruiser) made for JavaScript and TypeScript projects. It enforces boundaries by rules which are states in a configuration file. It includes graph visualization by creating an output file in DOT format.

## ArchUnit (Java)
<Badge text="Rule Enforcement" variant="note" />

[ArchUnit](https://www.archunit.org/) is an open-source tool for Java applications.
Port exists for [.NET](https://github.com/BenMorris/NetArchTest) and C#, too.
It enforces dependency rules by defining them within Unit tests.

## ImportLinter (Python)
<Badge text="Rule Enforcement" variant="note" />

[Import Linter](https://github.com/seddonym/import-linter/) also allows to define and enforce dependency rules within and between python packages.
It's a CLI tool and uses a configuration file (default `.importlinte`), which contains one or more 'contracts'.
It also possible to define [layers](https://import-linter.readthedocs.io/en/stable/contract_types.html#basic-usage).
No metrics get provided.

## Konsist (Kotlin)
<Badge text="Rule Enforcement" variant="note" />
A structural linter for Kotlin which works very similar to [ArchUnit](https://www.archunit.org/). It verifies the codebase in regards to user defined rules which can be created within Unit tests user the Konsist API.


## Arkit (JS/TS)
<Badge text="Visualization" variant="note" />
[Arkit](https://github.com/dyatko/arkit) Associates source files with configured architectural components and creates  grouped components and dependency graph diagrams including Node.js modules as local files.


## jQAssistant (Java)
<Badge text="Rule Enforcement" variant="note" />
[jQAssistant](https://github.com/jQAssistant/jqassistant) shows software analytics, verifies that current design is as indented using provided or user-defined rules. All in an XML file.

## Sonargraph
<Badge text="Rule Enforcement" variant="note" />
<Badge text="Visualization" variant="note" />
A tool by [Hello2Morrow](https://www.hello2morrow.com/products/sonargraph). Supports C#, C/C++, Java/Kotlin, TypeScript and Python 3.
It enforces layered architecture by a DSL, has metrics and visualizations like hotspots.

## Lattix
<Badge text="Visualization" variant="note" />
<Badge text="Documentation" variant="note" />
For multiple languages, like .NET, Java and C/C++.
Has visualization via the "Conceptual Architecture Diagram"
Does have metrics about coupling and get's shipped as desktop app.

## Summary

They are a couple of tools out there to help with the architecture of a codebase. Each modern programming language seems to have a tool for rule enforcement. Visualization is rarely present.
Also tools exists which do visualization.
The configuration is done within a config file as text for all tools.
None of them has a modern web application.
It's either package installed to the workspace without GUI, or a fat client.
