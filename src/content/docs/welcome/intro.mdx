This documentation will provide you with a comprehensive understanding of TangleGuard's features and benefits and will guide you through the installation and setup process.

TangleGuard main purpose is to **generates component diagrams** from source code.
This saves a lot of time and effort compared to creating them manually.
Creating those manually and keep them up-to-date is painful.

Your code is internally represented as graph (basically an adjacency list).
This allows not only to render diagrams, but also to perform more analysis on the code.
TangleGuard also offers to create **dependencies rules**, which describe how components are allowed to interact with each other.

These rules can be used to enforce an architectural style, like layered architectures, hexagonal architecture or clean architecture.
That way the codebase remains in that intended structure over the time.

It helps to create a **software architecture** which is an easy-to-maintain, hence scalable and cost effective.
TangleGuard is a tool made for [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).
It's also mainly written in Rust.
