### Is TangleGuard like a tracing tool (like OpenTelemetry)?

No. TangleGuard performs **static code analysis** to help you understand and enforce your software architecture.
Tracing tools like OpenTelemetry, on the other hand, operate **at runtime** to show how requests flow through a system.

| Feature               | TangleGuard                          | Tracing Tools (e.g., OpenTelemetry)         |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Type of analysis      | Static (based on code)               | Dynamic (runtime behavior)                  |
| Purpose               | Understand & enforce architecture    | Monitor, debug & trace runtime behavior     |
| Output visualization  | Modules, layers, dependency diagrams | Spans, traces, service maps                 |
| Use cases             | Architecture governance              | Observability, performance analysis         |
| Scope                 | Entire codebase                      | Specific runtime paths or services          |



### Is Rust really the only supported language?

Yes, Rust is the only supported language at the moment.
If the interest is enough to include other languages, we'll happily expand our support to other languages.
